Connecting my blog to the vast digital ocean of the World Wide Web!
I haven't been a blogger or a notes-for-everything person ever :),  but this blog represents my first push towards organizing and sharing things that I find interesting, things that I feel are worth to spend time, effort and energy to pursue and explore.

## About me
- My interests are mostly concentrated around Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Digital Image Processing and Software Architecture Design. 
- I've worked on multiple projects that used Deep Learning and ML techniques for Automatic Text Summarization and identifying Network Security Vulnerabilities.
- In my profession as a Software Developer I've worked on both client side and server side technologies.
- I love to code in Python and C++(11/14) (in that order) and have a fair bit of experience of working in Java and SQL.
- I've worked as a developer at [WalmartLabs, Bangalore](https://www.linkedin.com/company/walmart-labs-india/) and right now I am working at [Adobe, Noida](https://www.linkedin.com/company/adobe/?originalSubdomain=in). 

## About this blog
I plan to update this blog regularly about technological developments in the field of Computer Science and my attempts at making something out of them.
